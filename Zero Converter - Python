You are given a number n. The number n can be negative or positive.
If n is negative, print numbers from n to 0 by adding 1 to n. 
If positive, print numbers from n-1 to 0 by subtracting 1 from n.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 0
Output:
already Zero
Example 2:

Input:
n = 4
Output:
3 2 1 0
Example 3:

Input:
n = -3
Output:
-3 -2 -1 0

Solution:-
def pos(n):
    ## Write the code
    
    n = n-1
    while n>=0:
        print(n, end=" ")
        n -=1
        
    
def neg(n):
    while n<=0:
        print(n, end=' ')
        n +=1
